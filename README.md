# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

-Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They wanted me to help them modernize their operations and to help them implement and apply the latest security measures. 


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

-I did particularily well in auditing their vulnerabilities through the dependency check tool. I was very thorough. It is important to code securly because if you do not, or you do not keep up on updating your application, vulnerabilities can and will be both found and exploited by attackers. Security adds significant value to a company and is incredibly important. Being a secure company will certainly contribute to a positive well being.


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

-I found using the suppression portion of the dependency check to be challenging and I couldn't quite get it to do what I wanted it to.


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

-When adding the security, it was checked through dependency checks that there were no more security flaws or vulnerabilities added. HTTPS was instituted so that there would be a secure connection with the server. The encryption algorithm was checked via the use of a checksum to ensure that it was functioning properly as well. Through each of these additions, the company gained more and more layers of security, while adding no new vulnerabilities, as checked through the use of the dependency check. I would likely use the dependency check tool in the future to assess vulnerabilites and use the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram to determine potential mitigation techniques for security flaws.


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

-Through functional testinging, it was ensured that the code and software application were both functional and secure. The code was checked with the dependency check tool in order to ensure that no more vulnerabilities were added when the code was refactored.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

-A tool that I used was the dependency check tool, which I will likely use again in the future to check for dependencies, which will be helpful for secure coding in the future.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

-From these assignments, I would likely want to showcase my ability to explain complex topics in such a way that they make sense and are easily understood. I believe this might show a trait of leadership or some degree of authority, or at the very least the ability to teach and assist others, since the information is more digestable.
